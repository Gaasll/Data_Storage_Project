# Project Description, the Soundgood Music School
The purpose is to facilitate information handling and business transactions for the Soundgood music school company, by developing a database which handles all the school's data and also an application that handles the operations specified below.
# Business Overview
Soundgood sells music lessons to students who want to learn to play an instrument. When someone wants to attend the school, they submit contact details, which instrument they want to learn, and their present skill. If there is room, the student is offered a place. There is no concept like 'course' or sets of lessons. Instead, students continue to take lessons as long as they wish. Students pay per lesson and instructors are payed per given lesson.
